#The code has been modified to prioritize the headset webcam for hand detection while using other webcams to help with occluded fingers. Here are the key changes:

## 1. **Camera Classification**:
   - Added an `is_headset` parameter to identify the primary headset camera
   - User can select which camera is their headset at startup

## 2. **Enhanced Headset Camera Settings**:
   - Headset camera uses higher resolution (1280x720) and framerate (30 FPS)
   - Uses more accurate detection parameters (higher confidence thresholds)
   - Uses model_complexity=1 for better accuracy on the headset camera

## 3. **New Visualization System**:
   - Added separate display windows for:
     - Headset camera (primary view)
     - Auxiliary cameras (supporting views)
     - Fused view (combined tracking results)

## 4. **Added FusedHandTracker Class**:
   - Combines hand tracking data from all cameras
   - Prioritizes the headset camera's detections
   - Adds visual indicators when auxiliary cameras are helping with occluded fingers

## 5. **Visual Differentiation**:
   - Headset camera is labeled as "HEADSET Camera" in green
   - Auxiliary cameras are labeled as "Aux Camera" in orange
   - The fused view shows when auxiliary cameras are enhancing tracking

## 6. **Improved Performance**:
   - Auxiliary cameras use lower complexity models to save processing power
   - Headset camera gets more computing resources for better tracking

## This approach gives you the best of both worlds - the accuracy of the headset camera combined with additional perspective data from the auxiliary cameras to help with occlusion problems.

## To run the code
``` bash
python hand_tracking_multy4.py
```
